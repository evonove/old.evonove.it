Ladies and Gentlemen this was the location of the Qt World Summit 2015,
the absolutely incredible Berlin Congress Centre!
Here we attended to three days full of interesting talks about the latest developments in Qt world.

It was our first time at the Qt World Summit and it turned out to be a great occasion to touch the future,
discovering new technologies applications and features,
meeting face-to-face with the people behind the Qt frameworks and libraries such as Alex Leutgöb e Chris Feldbacher,
co-founders of V-Play.

V-Play is a cross-platform development framework for multiple screen games and
applications and we are really interested about it becouse we already worked on something similar.
The QtWS15 was the occasion to share our competencies and points of view directly with Alex and
Chris to be active contributors of their libs.

Part of our work was concretely at the conference through the speech of `Massimiliano Pippi <http://dev.pippi.im/>`_
How we stopped using the mouse and started drawing molecules with our fingertips: not the usual porting story.
On his talk, our friend `Masci <http://dev.pippi.im/>`_ presented a project
which let scientists take the advantages of a desktop scientific software application,
into a usable mobile app context. Evonove contributed to achieve the goal helping him and
developing two new Qt open source libraries.

Well, it cannot be amazing as being there but, you’ll have the next 12 months to thinking about the next edition.

Our next stop will be on November 1-5 at `Django under the Hood <http://www.djangounderthehood.com/>`_. Stay tuned!
