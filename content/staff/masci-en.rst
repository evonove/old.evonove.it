Software developer, Python lover, Dad.

I write Python and C++ code, maintain servers and services up and running, deploy web applications,
integrate software components, write documentation, help making decisions about tools and technologies. I would
definitely define myself as a troubleshooter.

As a long-time vegetarian, I currently hold the *Vegan Chef* position at Evonove.
