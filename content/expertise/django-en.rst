Django is a full stack, open source web framework written in Python 
finalized to the development of complex web applications.

Evonove can help customers on planning and developing Django projects 
and is active in the community by releasing the most of the code with 
an open source license and participating in several open source projects.

Django OAuth Toolkit
--------------------

Django OAuth Toolkit can help you providing out of the box all the endpoints, 
data and logic needed to add OAuth2 capabilities to your Django projects. 
Django OAuth Toolkit makes extensive use of the excellent OAuthLib, so that 
everything is rfc-compliant.

Django Stored Messages
----------------------

The app integrates smoothly with Django's messages framework (django.contrib.messages), 
but users can decide which messages have to be stored on the database backend and kept 
available over sessions.
