Videomapping is a projection technique used to display images on irregular
surfaces so they seem to emit light instead of receiving it, as they were real
screens. Through this technique we can add value to shapes and surfaces,
perfectly fulfilling advertising and entertaining needs.

We are specialized in mapping small and medium surfaces, goods and furnitures.
Our `Vimeo pages <http://vimeo.com/user11262087>`_ shows some of our works.
