Seriously, a circus? That perfectly fits the quote *And now for something completely different*!

Just got back from the latest DjangoCon Europe - I usually write a sort of log of the conferences I attend, this time
it'll be just a matter of thanks.

**Thanks to the organizers**, they possibly delivered the craziest tech conference I ever attended. Thanks for the **food**,
I much appreciated the veg option (I arrived in Warsaw prepared to starve, likely I gained weight). Thanks for the
**free and fresh beverages** constantly available for the attendees. Thanks for the **free beer** (don't now if and when it'll
happen again...). Thanks for the **free ice creams**, again, constantly available during the conference. Thanks for the
**goodies** (hammoks, blankets, cushions, deckchairs and so on...). Thanks for bringing me to **Warsaw**: nice people, nice
places, good food - it totally worths, even for a short weekend. Thanks to the **speakers**, some of them were very
inspiring and the amount of lighting talk was ridicolously huge! Thanks to `Emanuele </authors/palazzem>`_ who arranged
a very fun (and informative!) lighting talk in a few hours. And thanks to the **weather**, really don't know what could
have been happened in case of rain :-).
