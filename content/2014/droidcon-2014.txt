After Amsterdam, Bangalore, Berlin, Brussels, London, Murcia and Tunis the
`Droidcon <http://droidcon.com/>`_ arrives in Italy, `in Turin <http://it.droidcon.com/2014/>`_.
It'll be two days of talks, workshops, showcases and even an Hackaton dedicated to one of the most
widespread operating system in the world: Android.

At Droidcon you can see Android in action in every field of application: mobile devices, of course,
but even TV, cars, gaming and embedded systems. And we'll be there just to cover the latter: with
a `Udoo board <http://www.udoo.org/>`_ attached to a custom motorized rover,
`Emanuele </authors/palazzem>`_ is going to show off Android's potential pushing it beyond the
comfort of mobile devices with the talk `Release the Kraken <http://it.droidcon.com/2014/lineup/>`_.
The Internet of Things seems to be very attractive these days, people want to get their hands dirty
with the bare metal and media grasped the potential of the makers revolution, as you can see on
`this article <http://nova.ilsole24ore.com/esperienze/android-piu-open>`_ appeared on one of the
most authoritative business newspaper (only available in italian).
You can learn more on Emanuele's adventure at the Droidcon in
`this interview <http://www.techmate.it/droidcon/>`_ (again, only in italian) published on the electronic
magazine **Techmate**.
